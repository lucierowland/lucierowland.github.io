description: I’m passionate about sharing astronomy with a wide audience and love engaging with the public through talks, writing, and community events. I have given public talks through iTelescope.net, the Durham University Women in STEM (DUWIS) society in Durham, and Astronomy on Tap in Leiden, and I write regularly for Astrobites. My writing was recently featured in Zenit, a Dutch science magazine.
**I’m always happy to give talks, write pieces, or collaborate on outreach projects—please get in touch!**

# Astrobites

Astrobites is a daily astrophysical journal run by graduate students from all around the world. Every day, we post a 'bite' - a short summary of a recent research paper that we have summarised in a digestible way, targeted towards undergraduate students who want to learn more about the latest developments in Astrophysics.
