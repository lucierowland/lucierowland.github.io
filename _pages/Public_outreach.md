description: Communicating science is one of my favourite parts of being an astronomer. Alongside my PhD research, I have been writing science communication pieces with Astrobites and a featured article in Zenit (a science magazine in the Netherlands). I've also been invited to give public talks, including with the Copernicus Observatory, Astronomy on Tap, iTelescope.net, and the Durham University Women in STEM society.

# Astrobites

Astrobites is a daily astrophysical journal run by graduate students from all around the world. Every day, we post a 'bite' - a short summary of a recent research paper that we have summarised in a digestible way, targeted towards undergraduate students who want to learn more about the latest developments in Astrophysics.

See my page on Astrobites [here](https://astrobites.org/author/lrowland/)

# Public Science Talks
I recently had the opportunity to give a talk at Astronomy on Tap in Leiden at the ['Measuring the edge of Infinity'](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2025/07/astronomy-on-tap) event. My talk, 'A long time ago in galaxies far, far away...', was focused on the redshift frontier - an ongoing effort to discover and explore the most distant galaxies ever observed. See the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWwyXbgSqV8).
