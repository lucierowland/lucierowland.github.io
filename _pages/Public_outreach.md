description: Communicating science is one of my favourite parts of being an astronomer. I have given public talks through iTelescope.net, the Durham University Women in STEM (DUWIS) society, and Astronomy on Tap in Leiden, and I write regularly for Astrobites. My writing was recently featured in Zenit, a Dutch science magazine.

# Astrobites

Astrobites is a daily astrophysical journal run by graduate students from all around the world. Every day, we post a 'bite' - a short summary of a recent research paper that we have summarised in a digestible way, targeted towards undergraduate students who want to learn more about the latest developments in Astrophysics.

See my page on Astrobites [here](https://astrobites.org/author/lrowland/)

# Public Science Talks
I recently had the opportunity to give a talk at Astronomy on Tap in Leiden at the ['Measuring the edge of Infinity'](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2025/07/astronomy-on-tap) event. My talk, 'A long time ago in galaxies far, far away...', was focused on the redshift frontier - an ongoing effort to discover and explore the most distant galaxies ever observed. See the recording [here]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWwyXbgSqV8).

At iTelescope.net, I was invited to speak about how astronomers use observations to study the most distant galaxies in the Universe. See it on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h2Y_sa7-x0).
