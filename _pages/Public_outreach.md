# Astrobites

Astrobites is a daily astrophysical journal run by graduate students from all around the world. Every day, we post a 'bite' - a short summary of a recent research paper that we have summarised in a digestible way, targeted towards undergraduate students who want to learn more about the latest developments in Astrophysics.

See my page on Astrobites [here](https://astrobites.org/author/lrowland/).
