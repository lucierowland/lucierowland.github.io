    MUSE is an Integral Field Unit spectrograph, meaning we can take both images and spectra of our targets. Here is a spectrum of one of the HII regions analysed in this work.

    In this paper, we show how the feedback-related pressure terms within HII regions are dependent on properties such as the metallicity (left) and size (right) of the HII regions.
