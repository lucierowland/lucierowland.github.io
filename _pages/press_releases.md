## REBELS-25: my first-author PhD paper & press release
For my first PhD project, I led a study of a galaxy just ~700 million years after the Big Bang (z = 7.31), known as **REBELS-25**. Against expectations, we found it’s a **dynamically cold, rotation-supported disc** — more like an orderly Milky Way–style spiral than the turbulent systems we thought dominated the early Universe.  
This is the **most distant, confirmed rotating disc galaxy** (so far), and it pushes theories about how quickly galaxies can settle into stable discs.

See the ESO press release [here](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2415/) and the CNN article [here](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/16/science/rebels-25-disc-galaxy-paper-scli-intl/index.html).

## 20 March 2025 — Oxygen in the most distant confirmed galaxy (JADES-GS-z14-0)
Using ALMA, our community detected **oxygen** in **JADES-GS-z14-0**, locking in its extreme distance and showing that **chemical enrichment began astonishingly early** — when the Universe was under ~300 million years old.  
I’m a **co-author** on this work, which was **led by my Leiden colleague Sander Schouws**.

## 4 September 2025 — PHOENIX: new ALMA Large Programme
I’m a **member of the PHOENIX collaboration** (PI **Sander Schouws**), a newly awarded **ALMA Large Programme** that will target some of the **earliest galaxies** to understand how dust and the interstellar medium built up so quickly after the Big Bang — in synergy with JWST.
