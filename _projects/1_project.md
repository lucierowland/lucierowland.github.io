Dwarf galaxies may be small, but they play a huge role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. During my Masters' at Durham University, I focused on a sample of nearby, low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, where stellar feedback plays a crucial role in regulating star formation. Using cutting-edge techniques like integral field spectroscopy and stochastic stellar population models, I investigate how feedback from these stars evolves and varies based on the properties of their host galaxies. This research helps bridge the gap between our understanding of large spiral galaxies and these fascinating, small-scale systems.

    MUSE is an Integral Field Unit spectrograph, meaning we can take both images and spectra of our targets. Here is a spectrum of one of the HII regions analysed in this work.

    In this paper, we show how the feedback-related pressure terms within HII regions are dependent on properties such as the metallicity (left) and size (right) of the HII regions.
